## About the Article

-   "Expanding Tidy Data Principles to Facilitate Missing Data Exploration, Visualization, and Assessment of Imputations"
-   Tierney ve Cook (2023)
-   Journal of Statistical Software
-   Missing data analysis and visualization has been improved by offering new functions with the "Naniar" package.

## Methods

1)  Tidy Data Principles

2)  Nabular Data:

3)  Visual and Numerical Summaries of Missing Data:

    | Variable | n_miss | pct_miss |
    |----------|--------|----------|
    | Ozone    | 37     | 24.2     |
    | Solar.R  | 7      | 4.6      |
    | Wind     | 0      | 0.0      |
    | Temp     | 0      | 0.0      |
    | Month    | 0      | 0.0      |
    | Day      | 0      | 0.0      |

## Dataset

```{r sleep-dataset, echo = TRUE}
data("sleep", package = "VIM")
head(sleep)
```
```{r sleep-dataset01, echo = TRUE}
data("sleep", package = "VIM")
describe(sleep)
```

Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) Test:
```{r sleep-dataset1, echo = TRUE}
mcar_test(sleep)
```

### Missing Data Operations

```{r sleep-dataset2, echo = TRUE}
# Column showing the number of missing values in each row.
sleep <- add_n_miss(sleep)
# Column showing the proportion of missing values in each row.
sleep <- add_prop_miss(sleep)
# Column showing whether there are missing values in each row.
sleep <- add_any_miss(sleep)
# Column showing missing data groups.
sleep <- add_miss_cluster(sleep)
```
```{r sleep-dataset3, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat('<div class="scrollable-table">')
print(knitr::kable(head(sleep)))
cat('</div>')
```


Scanning the signals used to represent missing data:
```{r sleep-dataset4, echo = TRUE}
miss_val <- c("N/A", "Null", "NaN", "-99")
miss_scan_count(sleep, search = miss_val)
```


Converting sleep data to nabular data:
```{r sleep-dataset5, echo = TRUE}
sleep_nabular <- nabular(sleep)
```
```{r sleep-dataset6, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat('<div class="scrollable-table">')
print(knitr::kable(head(sleep_nabular)))
cat('</div>')
```


Temporary missing data assignment of "10% below the range" to examine patterns in missing data:
```{r sleep-dataset7, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
sleep_imputed <- impute_below_all(sleep_nabular)
```

Temporary imputation of missing data can alternatively be done using the mean or median:
```{r sleep-dataset8, echo = TRUE}
# sleep_imputed <- impute_mean_all(sleep_nabular)
# sleep_imputed <- impute_median_all(sleep_nabular)
```
```{r sleep-dataset9, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat('<div class="scrollable-table">')
print(knitr::kable(head(sleep_imputed)))
cat('</div>')
```


DExamining the distribution of missing data with density plot:
```{r sleep-dataset10, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_density(data = sleep, aes(x = Sleep, fill = "Original"), alpha = 0.5, na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_density(data = sleep_imputed, aes(x = Sleep, fill = "Imputed"), alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Sleep", title = "Density Plot of Sleep Hours", fill = "Data Type") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Original" = "red", "Imputed" = "green")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Graphics Functions Offered in Naniar Package

```{r sleep-dataset11, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Plot of missing values in each variable
gg_miss_var(sleep)

# Plot of missing data in each row
gg_miss_case(sleep)

# Visualization of complex missing data patterns
gg_miss_upset(sleep)

# An overview of loss
vis_miss(sleep)
```

### Numeric Summary Functions Offered in the Naniar Package

```{r sleep-dataset12, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
n_miss(sleep) # total number of lost data
prop_miss(sleep) # proportion of missing data
pct_miss(sleep) # percentage of missing data
```

```{r sleep-dataset13, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Summary by variable
miss_var_summary(sleep)

# Summary table by variable
miss_var_table(sleep)

# Summary by column
miss_case_summary(sleep)

# Summary by row
miss_case_table(sleep)
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages:

-   Graphs: Provides successful graphs to visualize missing data and see the connection between them.
-   Detailed Analysis: Offers successful functions to perform superficial or detailed analysis.
-   Compatibility with Tidyverse: A package developed integrated with Tidyverse that will be useful for those working with the tidyverse approach.

Disadvantages:

-   Exploratory Analysis Focus: Exploratory missing data analysis is emphasized but statistical tests or detailed analytical methods are not emphasized.
-   R Programming Language Focus: Since it is based on R and Tidyverse, it cannot be used by those who prefer other programming languages, so the potential user base is narrow.
-   Performance in Large Datasets: When faced with large data, performance may decrease, and more effective approaches can be implemented for this issue.
